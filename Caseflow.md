# Caseflow (Caseflow) #2114
Caseflow is a system that will ultimately replace the Veterans Appeals Control and Locator System (VACOLS) as the system of record for appeals. Caseflow will provide functionality to the Board of Veterans' Appeals and other departments/stakeholders to enable the processing and tracking of appeals and related processes. The system will leverage integrations with VA systems to provide functionality that improves the efficiency of working with appeals and other documents, including the VBMS eFolder.
